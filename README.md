#OOP--Assignment_2



The bassis of my project is built in the concept of a drifting car game however with the added trail element of tron to try and kill your oppenent.

Most prowed of:

Saddly the thing I was most prowed of saddly when impplamented made the game run like a powerpoint presentation. It was a really neet skid affect.As the car would drift in a array list would be the wheels of the car stored for 20 and then the last one would be removed. The code is still there just commened out. If you would like to see it just uncoment or download a old version from git with the skid manics 

Another thing I was prowed of the drift macanics and how it would glide around the screen.

# Concept

2nd assignment from my OOP module from 2nd year, 2016 - 2017 . This Assignment is inspired by the retro game "Tron", with added features that I feel makes the game more challanging.The bassis of my project is built in the concept of a drifting car game however with the added trail element of tron to try and kill your oppenent.

# Features
The Game has four features.

* Menu
  * Contains the tumb nail
  
* Drift machanics
  * Lets the player glide around and skid 
  
* Tyer skid 
  * leaves a skid mark as the player moves around. 
  
* Trail 
  * Leaves a trail of bombs behind the player 


#Controls

The game is extreamly simple controls, however is extramly tricky as it drifts around the screen.

* Player 1 Controls:
A key = rotate left
D key = rotate right 

* Player 2 Controls 
J key = rotate left 
K key = rotate right 

#Functionality

The objective is to drift around the space while dropping mines out the back of your car to kill the other player, while avoiding the other player who is doing the exact same thing to you. If one of the Players hits the bomb then the other player wins.It dose this by checking if the bomb is within the hit box of the car then the game is over and the winner is declared.
